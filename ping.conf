# Sample ping.conf.
# Should be copied in /etc.
# You need PING 1.12 or more for a /etc/ping.conf file to be used.
#
# How to modify your initrd.gz file:
# 1. Boot PING on a machine that has at least 256 Mo of RAM
# 2. Get a shell when proposed to, by typing 'x' and Enter
# 3. Login as root, no password
# 4. Connect to your network:
#    - If there's a DHCP server, type: dhcpcd
#    - Else, type (adjust to your config):
#      - ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.26 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
#      - route add default gw 192.168.0.1
# 5. Mount a remote share (where your initrd.gz file can be found):
#    - mount.cifs //192.168.0.1/d\$ /mnt/smbfs -o user=domain\\username
#      (or just user=username if this is a local user)
# 6. Assuming both your initrd.gz and ping.conf files are located
#    in the root of the share, type:
#    - gzip -d /mnt/smbfs/initrd.gz
#    - mount -o loop /mnt/smbfs/initrd /mnt/loop
#    - mkdir /tmp/rootfs
#    - cd /tmp/rootfs
#    - tar xvfj /mnt/loop/rootfs.tar.bz2
#    - cp /mnt/smbfs/ping.conf /tmp/rootfs/etc/ping.conf
#    - tar cvf - * |bzip2 -9 - >/mnt/loop/rootfs.tar.bz2
#    - umount /mnt/loop
#    - gzip -9 /mnt/smbfs/initrd
#
# Remember that Linux's shell is case-sensitive.

# Tell here what are the TCP/IP parameters of your first network card.
# If you let them commented, dhcp will be tried on your first network card,
# then on your possible second network card if dhcp fails on first one.
# If dhcp fails, IP/Netmask/GW will be asked.
#
#IP=192.168.0.26
#Netmask=255.255.255.0
#Gateway=192.168.0.1

# If you want to use a non-default DHCP timeout, set it here in seconds.
# Let the parameter commented out if default is fine to you (most users).
#
#DHCP_Timeout=15

# Tell here where we can store/retrieve the system images (SMBFS/CIFS).
#
# Images stored on the network:
#   Server must be an IP, sorry no DNS.
#
# Images stored locally:
#   Use Server to tell PING on which device they'll be found.
#   Example: Server=/dev/hda1
#
#   If the image can be stored either on hda1, either on sda1, etc., specify
#   a comma-separated list of possibilities. They'll all be tried in the order
#   you provide, until the image to restore is found.
#   Example: Server=/dev/hda1,/dev/sda1,/dev/hda2,/dev/sda2
#
#   In this case, Share, User and Passwd are not to be provided, being useless.
#   But the Directory param might be necessary.
#
Server=172.16.41.54
Share=images
User=administrator
Passwd=topsecret
Directory=partimage

# You can also specify here the name of the image to restore.
# Typically, you would then specify also where to retrieve the
# system images.
#
# In the case you would like to automatize the creation of a
# new image, set Image_To_Restore to Create_New_Image. If you
# also want to force the name of that future image, use the
# New_Image_Name parameter. You may also set now the names of
# the partitions you'll want PING to store.
#
# Finally, if there's already an image in your Directory called
# after the New_Image_Name you have set, you might define here
# what PING should do with the Already_Existing_Image parameter.
# Set it either to "Replace" (old dir will be removed), either to
# "Rename" (old dir will be renamed to xxx.OLD.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS),
# either to "Update". The Update choice is only possible when the
# preexisting image has been made with version 3.00 or greater
# of PING, and if a xxxx.RecFiles.txt have been recorded (ex.:
# sda1.RecFiles.txt for partition /dev/sda1), containing the
# sizes and checksums of all files found on the part's filesystem.
# And if you set Already_Existing_Image to "Update,Replace",
# PING will try to update, but Replace if there's no
# xxxx.RecFiles.txt. "Update,Rename" is the last possible choice.

# If Repart is set to Y, and if you've got only one partition on
# your local hard disk drive and want to store an image of it
# locally, then this unique partition will be splitted for you.
# If set to N, PING will simply exit. And if commented, you'll
# be asked for what to do. May we suggest you'd better partition
# yourself for this kind of situation.

# What will PING do after the job is finished ? can be

# - Reboot
# - Shutdown

After_Completion=Shutdown

# Will we replace the BIOS if a "bios" file is found ?
# Note that you can simply delete this "bios" file before
# making your restorations to avoid having your bios params
# modified, but in some cases, you might want to have the
# bios settings recorded, and to restore them on a selection
# of target stations.
#

# To map a MS share, SAMBA can use either SMBFS either CIFS.
# For some reasons, it has been constated that CIFS can be
# much faster than SMBFS on some types of networks. And the
# contrary is true, too!
#
# Note: SMBFS is deprecated and will be removed soon.
#
CIFS_Preferred=Y

# To map a NFS share, use this option. The command PING will
# use will look like this:
#   mount -t nfs SERVER:/home/y/share/ping /mnt/smbfs
#
# Use above Server, Share, Directory parameters. To make it
# clear: above param Server is "SERVER", above param Share is
# "/home/y/share", and above param Directory is "ping".
# Parameters User and Passwd are *not* used.
#
# Finally, if you need to add files to the PING tree, add a
# a addon-xxxx.tar.gz file to your image (same place as kernel
# and initrd.gz). It will be untarred to the root of the OS
# before any operation is done.
#
#NFS_Preferred=Y

# To map a FTP share, use this option.
#
# Use above Server, Directory, User, Passwd parameters.
# The Share parameter has no use in this case.

#   but have been unable to create an image to such a share.

# It can be interesting to reduce the size of the partition
# before storing it. Thus, it's possible to restore it later
# into a smaller partition. Note that even if we decide later
# to restore into a equally-big or bigger partition, PING will
# always try to maximize the size of the filesystem at the end.

# If you want NO QUESTION to be raised, no popup at all,

AUTO=Y

# Cmd_1 is a command for PING to execute before the first blue
# welcome screen, Cmd_2 is a command for PING to execute after

# Think of it as a tool to combine with a possible add-on.

# Set this parameter to Y to prevent the user from creating

# Sometimes, you create an image from an IDE disk, and files
# are called hda, hda1.000, etc. and you want to restore it to
# a system with a SATA disk, and this device is called /dev/sda,
# and because of this, PING won't restore anything (unless you
# rename hda to sda etc.)
#
# In our example, if you set the Its_HDA_Stupid param to Y,
# PING will look for a sda device and restore to it.
# Else, PING will propose a list of possible targets.
# Basically, set this param to Y if you want no interactivity
# and if you generally have both IDE and SATA/SCSI devices.
#
#Its_HDA_Stupid=Y

# If set to Y, we'll mount R/W NTFS filesystems even if they
# have the dirty flag set. It's not recommended, of course,
# but it might help sometimes.
#
#Force_Dirty_NTFS_Mount=Y

# Sometimes, you'll restore images to a bigger drive.
# Sometimes, there will be empty space after or between parts.
# Set this parameter to Y if you want PING to extend partitions

# You can have PING store all names, sizes and MD5 checksums
# of files contained in a partition you store. In this case,
# this information will be stored in a file called
# sda.RecFiles.txt and stored in your image directory.
# The presence of this file will make it possible for you
# to have PING update this image later.
#
# (Not really an update, because partimage and zsplit-stored
# files cannot be addressed, but modified or added files will
# be stored in an archive, added to the partimage/zsplit files).
